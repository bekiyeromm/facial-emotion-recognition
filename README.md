Abstract
This study focuses on developing a real-time Ethiopian facial emotion recognition system using
deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Given Ethiopia's
rich cultural diversity and unique social dynamics, the research aims to create a model that
classifies facial expressions into five categories: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutral.
The system utilizes Haar cascade classifier for face detection and applies histogram equalization
for effective image preprocessing to address challenges posed by varying illumination conditions.
The CNN architecture comprises five convolutional layers with progressively larger filter sizes,
supplemented by max pooling, batch normalization, and fully connected layers, which enhances
feature extraction and classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the system
achieves an impressive 90% accuracy, with fast prediction times and reliable performance. By
emphasizing culturally relevant emotion recognition, this research contributes to the broader field
of AI in Ethiopia, highlighting the importance of developing models that are effective across
diverse cultural contexts and addressing local challenges in facial emotion recognition.
